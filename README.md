# fire-2020-Dravidian-CodeMix
A sentiment analysis shared task on the Tamil and Malayalam code-mixed text

First run the elmo file to get the elmo embeddings (it takes time, i have run it on google colab)
Run the fastText file to get the fasttext embeddings

The above embeddings are not available in the repository as they have exceeded the githubt 25mb limit.

I will update them in google drive if one wants to directly use them with the meta embedding program. The link will be provided later.

After obtaining the embeddings, run the fasttext+elmo+tf_idf+transformer file for sentiment analysis. change the language option to tamil or malayalam.
